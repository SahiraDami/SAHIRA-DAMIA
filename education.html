            <head><font color="black" size="5">My education is simple because I am a person who does not like to move. At the age of 5 and 6 years, I got my early education in preschool which is the preschool of this school. This pre-school is located in the SKSK building as well. Then, when I turned 7 to 12 years old, I continued my education at Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Kundang or we known as SKSK. This school is the closest school from my house. Therefore, this can make it easier for me and also my parents to send me to school at close range on a daily basis.</font></head>

I started at this school at the age of 13 until I successfully completed my secondary education at the age of 17 by successfully taking and obtaining results for the SPM examination which is Malaysia Certificate of Education which is an examination that must be passed for further education.</font></head>
