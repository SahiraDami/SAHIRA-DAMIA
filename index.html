        <head><font color="black" size="5">Hey, I’m Damia! Very cheerful and happy go lucky person. Someone who likes to try new things? Yes, that’s me! I’m obsessed to explore new things because I love to get more experience in my life. I can say that I am a person who is easily independent and easily comfortable with people. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people. I meet new people who are comfortable with me. I believe that friendship is one of the most important value in humas life. It is because from friendship, we can exchange new ideas and find many interesting things in our life. I’m very appreciate friendship and people who surround me. I also really like listening to music because for me music can calm me down when I have problems or stress. I hate stress the most. In my opinion, stress will ruin what I had planned for the day. The goal I’m currently striving is to be a successful person in the future and have a high quality of life. With all I already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best for my future.</font></head>
